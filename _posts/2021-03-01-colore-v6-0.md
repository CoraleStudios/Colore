So after a way too long hiatus, I finally got around to actually releasing version 6.0 of Colore!
You can download it from NuGet like all the previous releases :)

You can find most of the details on [the release page for it](https://github.com/chroma-sdk/Colore/releases/tag/v6.0.0).

There are a lot of breaking changes regarding the APIs, so you'll probably need to update most of the code that interacts with Colore,
but I hope the new design should feel more logical compared to the old one in v5.x.

Notably the library is now async with support for the REST API from Razer.

**One caveat to note:** When initializing the library, at least when using the native interface, you'll need to delay any following
Colore code by a second or so due to internal undocumented delays in the SDK. You can also listen for the `DeviceAccess` event to be
raised and see if device access has been granted, meaning you can start issuing calls to the hardware. More details are laid out in
issues [#274][issue-274] and [#279][issue-279].

I hope you'll enjoy version 6.0 of Colore! Even if it took way longer than it should have to get it released.
