There have not been a lot of updates lately, due to the CoraleStudios team being busy with work and such things.

I will try to clean things up for a 5.2 release of Colore (potentially), and then work on the 6.0 release which will
target .NET Standard. There will be a lot of things changing in the new major version, perhaps even support for the
new REST API for Chroma, so stay tuned!
