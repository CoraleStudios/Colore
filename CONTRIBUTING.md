# Contributing

We deeply appreciate anyone wanting to contribute to Colore!

In order to make the code neat, readable, and organized properly, there are some guidelines and rules you must follow.

Always remember, if you are unsure about something: check the existing source to get an idea of how things should look!

If you have more specific questions about the guidelines or other things about the project, feel free to contact anyone
listed under `PRIMARY AUTHORS` in the [AUTHORS file][authors] or [create an issue][] in the [main repo][]. You can also
[join the Gitter chat][gitter] and ask your questions.

## Cloning the repo

First off, fork the repository and clone it to your local development system:

```
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/Colore.git
```

## General design guidelines

 * Design your code to be event-driven when possible, it makes it easier for applications to implement the library.
 * Follow common C# practices for cleaner looking code (properties instead of `Get<Name>` methods, for example).

## Development requirements

*2015-12-22:* With Colore now being written using C# 6.0 features, you will need to use an edition of
Visual Studio 2015 to develop on Colore.

## StyleCop

*Updated 2015-12-22: Colore is now on C# 6.0 which meant a move from the old StyleCop package to the new
StyleCop.Analyzers package which implements StyleCop rules as Roslyn analyzers.*

Colore references the [StyleCop.Analyzers][stylecopanalyzers] package,
which will analyze the code and point out any errors.

A global ruleset file `Corale.Colore.ruleset` provided with Colore defines the rules we use for Colore and will be
used by analyzing tools automatically.

If there are any conflicts between this guide and what StyleCop tells you, **always follow what StyleCop says**.
This guide may not always be up to date with the latest changes to what rules we are using. If you feel unsure,
feel free to create an issue or contact the primary developers or post a question in the [Gitter][gitter] chat room.

### StyleCop exception cases

If you feel unsure about whether a certain StyleCop rule should *really* be followed,
feel free to [create an issue][] with your question.

You may also submit a pull request with your changes and we will notify you if something looks wrong.

## ReSharper

ReSharper is used by the primary developers of Colore and as such, we provide a setting file with Colore that
configures ReSharper with the settings we recommend using (such as naming conventions). If you use ReSharper,
make sure that the *team-shared* settings are being used.

### StyleCop plugin in ReSharper

Currently (2015-12-22) there seem to be issues with the StyleCop plugin in ReSharper (regardless of which version
is used) which makes ReSharper perform StyleCop analysis according to the default ruleset even if the
`StyleCop.Analyzers` package is installed. We therefore recommend *disabling the StyleCop plugin in ReSharper*
if it isn't already.

## Mandatory file header

The following file header **must be present in every code file**, if it is missing your code will not be accepted until
the header has been put in place.

Invalid or missing file headers are detected by the StyleCop analyzers and can be remedied by utilizing the provided
quick fix from within the editor.

## Indenting

Use 4 **spaces** for indenting (**not tabs!**). No more, no less.
Every decent IDE (and even text editor) lets you change this.

Code with incorrect indentation will not be accepted until corrected.

## Using declarations

*StyleCop will notify you about incorrect using statements.*

Put using statements as deep as possible (usually it will be just after the namespace declaration)
and in alphabetical order.

`System.*` namespaces are always put at the top in their own alphabetical order.

### Example showing correctly sorted using statements

```c#
using System;

using Colore.Core;

using SomeAuthor.SomeLib;
```

(Space between using groups is optional, but can often make it easier to read.)

## Naming

StyleCop will tell you how to name things most of the time. The only thing worth mentioning is that private fields
are named by prefixing them with an underscore. The only exception is for `const` and `static readonly` in which case
they are named using PascalCase.

```c#
// Naming example for a private variable
private SomeType _myVar;

// Naming example for a private static readonly
private static readonly SomeType MyVar;
```

If you are using ReSharper, it will manage this for you, as we are using its default naming scheme.

### Exceptions to naming convention

You should always try to name everything in a C#-idiomatic way, but we may make exceptions for exceptional cases,
like when importing native code fragments.

## Exception throwing and handling

Try not to catch the base `Exception` class, always catch specific exceptions that you are certain your code can handle.

When throwing exceptions, throw a type that is relevant to the error that occurred, don't throw a base `Exception`
if an argument is `null`, throw the `ArgumentNullException`.

If creating custom exception types, append `Exception` to the name and inherit from the relevant base exception class,
as per usual C# guidelines. Try to keep exception names short but descriptive.

## Usage of the `var` keyword

With fancy IDEs and other tools, the need to explicitly specify the type of a variable is not as important.

If you look through the source, you'll find that the `var` keyword is used extensively.

However, whether or not you use the `var` keyword doesn't matter too much. If you find a piece of code more
readable with the full type name, then write the full type name.

Use your own judgement to decide whether using the `var` keyword makes your code more readable.

That said, there are situations where using the `var` keyword is strongly encouraged, when the type name is mentioned
in the statement (typically on assignment operations):

```c#
// Consider this line of code:
SpecialSuperType[] myArray = new SpecialSupertype[10];
// here it would be preferred to use the var keyword, as the type is already mentioned in the assignment
var myArray = new SpecialSuperType[10];
```

## Calling native Chroma SDK functions

**Never call native SDK functions directly**. If implementing new SDK functions, add a wrapper function for them in
[NativeWrapper.cs][nativewrapper] first, then call them using that wrapper. Look at the existing code in the file for
an idea of how they are written. The bare requirement for a wrapper function is that it must encapsulate and isolate
the API call fully and handle the returned result value, throwing a `NativeCallException` if it failed.

## Documenting your code

Public-facing components of your code **must** have documentation. We will not merge pull requests that are missing
documentation on public members.

Use standard C# XML documentation comments for documenting your code, like so:

```c#
/// <summary>
/// Opens a webpage.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="url">The URL to open.</param>
/// <returns><c>true</c> if the webpage opened, <c>false</c> otherwise.</returns>
public bool OpenWebpage(string url)
{
    // Code...
}
```

If you are using Visual Studio, it will automatically insert the proper tags for you when you type three slashes
where applicable (`///`).

Please use proper grammar and punctuation in your documentation comments for the convenience of the reader.
We understand that not everyone is a native English speaker or have perfect language skills, and so we are pretty
relaxed with the proper-ness of documentation comments.

Simply: Badly written documentation comments are still better than no documentation comments at all.
The important thing is that you can write something understandable. We will tell you in the pull request if there's
something you can improve before we merge it.

If you're referencing/importing/wrapping functions from external sources like the WinAPI or Razer's APIs you can simply
copy documentation from the original source (MSDN for example). This usually means you get properly written
documentation that is easy (ok, most of the time anyway) to understand.

## Submitting a pull request

Good, we didn't scare you off with all these requirements,
and you are on your way to submitting your first pull request! (Hopefully).

When making a pull request, if is often convenient to make a branch just for that request (so that you can continue
working on your main development branch while your pull request is being reviewed). These branches are typically
named `patch-<counter>` but can be anything you desire, like a descriptive name for what the PR is about. If you
decide to name branches based on the change, make sure you keep them quite short.

Another very positive thing for both you and us, the maintainers, is to avoid pull requests with a lot of commits that
don't share anything in common. Imagine if you submit a pull request that implements a car and a bicycle. We decide
that we like your car implementation, but not the bicycle one. But we can't choose, as you put them both in the
same pull request!

So always make sure that your pull request is handling **one type of feature or change**.

Other things to keep in mind is to include details about what your feature or change is about in the pull request
message. The more information the better! And make sure to give your pull request a relevant name, too.

### Pull request target branch

When submitting your pull request, make sure you are targeting the [`develop`][develop] branch of the main repo.
If you target the wrong branch we will close your pull request. Don't feel bad though, just re-create it with the
correct target branch! (We have to close it as GitHub does not support changing the target
branch on an existing pull request.)

#### Hotfixes

Hotfixes are special, and are treated differently than other branches. A hotfix is branched from master and merged
back into master and then to develop. If you ever write a hotfix, keep this in mind. **Hotfixes branch from master,
*not develop*.**
